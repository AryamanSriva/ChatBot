# Chatbot

A simple AI chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning. This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot that classifies user inputs into intents using an LSTM-based model and responds accordingly.


## Features

- Intent classification using LSTM (via TensorFlow/Keras)
- Tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK
- JSON-based training data (intents, patterns and responses)
- Save and reload trained model
- Randomized responses for more natural interaction


## Skills Used

- Natural Language Processing
- Deep Learning (LSTM)
- Data preprocessing


## Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK
- TensorFlow
- Pillow


## Future Improvements

- Add more intents as well as training data
- Use transformer-based models (BERT)
- Deployment
